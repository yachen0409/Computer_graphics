Dear all,

In this homework, your goal is to load a 3D mesh and render it on the screen. Attached is a waveform object file. You can refer to page 78, cg-03-view_projection.pdf, for the format details. Please normalize the object to have a unit size (max(height, width, depth) = 1) and place the object at the origin. In addition, you have to 1) set a couple of lights in the environment to make the object visually appealing and 2) provide a trackball interface (page 101, cg-02-transform.pdf) for users to change the viewpoint interactively. 

PS1: You only have to submit your source codes. No reports are needed.
PS2: You have to implement the game using C++ & OpenGL. Using game engines, such as Unity or Unreal, is not allowed.
PS3: Zip your project folder and name the file "your_student_ID.zip" and upload it to E3. Please set the library and directory using relative paths and make sure that they work well so that TAs can compile your codes easily. Otherwise, you will lose 10 points on your homework. This is mandatory since TAs have to grade 90 homework. It will never be a good idea for them to set the paths for all your homework.
PS4: The overdue date is Dec. 12. You have a second chance to submit your homework. However, you lose 20 points on your homework if you don't make it on Dec. 5.
